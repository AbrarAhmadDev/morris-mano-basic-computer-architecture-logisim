# morris-mano-basic-computer-architecture-logisim
A complete, from-scratch, implementation of the Morris Mano Basic Computer designed in Logisim. This project covers registers, ALU, memory, control logic, and instruction execution based on Mano’s Computer System Architecture.

📌 Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Morris Mano Basic Computer architecture designed using Logisim.
The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer organization and architecture, including datapath design, control logic, registers, and instruction execution at the hardware level.

The design is split into:
1) a main computer circuit, and
